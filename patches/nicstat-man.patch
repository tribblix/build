-Specify the speed (and optionally duplex mode) of one or more interfaces.
-The given speed(s) are in megabits/second.
-The duplex mode will default to "full" unless a suffix beginning with
-"h" or "H" is specified.
-Speed and duplex mode are obtained automatically on Solaris using the
-"ifspeed" and "link_duplex" kstat values.

 .SH NOTES
 .PP
-On Linux, the NoCP, Defer, TCP InKB, and TCP OutKB statistics are
-always reported as zero.
-.PP
 The way that saturation is reported is a best effort, as there is no
 standardized naming to capture all errors related to an interface's
 inability to receive or transmit a packet.  Monitoring %Util and
 packet rates, along with an understanding of the specific NICs may be
 more useful in judging whether you are nearing saturation.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-S
-option is provided for the Linux edition as nicstat requires
-super-user privilege to obtain speed and duplex mode information for
-interfaces.
-If you are unable to set up nicstat as setuid-root, a script named
-.B enicstat
-is available, which uses the
-.B ethtool
-utility then calls nicstat with an
-.B \-S
-value.
-.B ethtool
-itself requires super-user privilege for this to work.
