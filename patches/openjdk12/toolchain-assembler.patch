With a Studio build, it needs to use the Sun as assembler. With a gcc build,
using the Sun assembler does work, but if that's not installed it will try
and use the gnu as directly, which doesn't work as it doesn't understand
the -m64 flag. The solution is to make this a toolchain switch rather than
an OS switch, and compile assembler with the compiler the same way other
platforms do with the gcc toolchain.
