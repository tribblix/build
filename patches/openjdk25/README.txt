JDK 25 now that jdk24 has been branched off.

IMPORTANT: note that the build target has changed, from 'all' to
'product-images', as 'all' tries to build a static image which doesn't
work.

25.0.1

Trivial patch noise.

25+36

Cleanup: remove custom redefinition of NULL (as NULL has been replaced
by nullptr everywhere in hotspot).

Cleanup: last mention of STACK_BIAS.

Cleanup: Tidy up attach code.

25+30, 25+31, 25+32, 25+33, 25+34, 25+35

No changes.

25+28, 25+29

Trivial patch noise.

25+27

Cleanup: remove SPARC-only pack64/unpack64.

Cleanup: tidy away legacy code from NetworkInterface.

25+26

Now in rampdown.

Minor patch noise. Remove #include "runtime/statSampler.hpp"

Cleanup: use isnan() just like everyone else.

Cleanup: only include <thread.h> where it's actually needed.

25+25

Trivial patch noise.

Implement os::fetch_bcp_from_context()

25+24

Minor patch noise.

25+23

Minor patch noise.

Remove runtime/threadCritical.hpp include.

25+22

Minor patch noise.

Cleanup: remove the Studio type linkage block from the gcc header.

25+21

Minor patch noise.

Replace ALL_64_BITS with all_bits_jlong.

Replace ALLOW_C_FUNCTION() with permit_forbidden_function::

Remove clock_tics_per_sec

Replace debug_only() with DEBUG_ONLY()

Replace sprintf

os::reserver_memory has an extra argument

FORBID_C_FUNCTION is now a hard failure in hotspot, so use of
sprintf() needed to be replaced by snprintf() or os::snprintf()

FORBID_IMPORTED_C_FUNCTION likewise warns for free and calloc; remove
check_addr0 which is the caller (and was used back in jdk11 as part of
run_periodic_checks, but not any more)

25+20

Trivial patch noise.

Cleanup: remove the java_props_md to reduce misalignment.

Cleanup: remove the unshuffle_list.txt hunk.

Cleanup: remove libjvm_dtrace, as it was associated with attachListener.

Cleanup: enable dtrace probes by default.

Cleanup: unnecessary use of thread instead of pthread.

Cleanup: SolarisFileSystem is always for 5.11 and up.

Cleanup: no need for -lposix4 and -lrt.

Cleanup: fix zgc so it builds again.

Cleanup: no need to patch socket_md.c, we're pthreads.

Cleanup: Tidy conditionals in MFontConfiguration.java.

Fix: Enable a minimal DTrace build. This just enables the shared
probes, as also available on MacOS and Linux. The solaris-specific
probes, and libjvm_db, are not provided and may be completely removed
in future.

Cleanup: remove solaris-specific X11CNS11643, we should be the same as
everything else.

Cleanup: remove dtraceAttacher and last unused (since 25+15) bits of
dtrace from attachListener. Removes illumos-port-17.patch

Cleanup: more dtrace fixes.

Cleanup: Correct DTRACE_INSTRUMENTED_OBJS.

Cleanup: NULL in os/solaris.

Fix: Correct type argument to sema_init.

Cleanup: Duplicate check for SC_CLK_TCK.

Cleanup: Trust gethostname rather than second-guessing.

Cleanup: Remove unused OPENJDK_$1_CPU_ISADIR.

25+19

Minor patch noise.

Rework jvm_path() to match other platforms, as sun_java_launcher_is_altjvm()
has been removed.

Cleanup: Remove more Studio-specific flags, still present in
DTrace. This doesn't make DTrace build, but is one problem less.

25+18

Minor patch noise.

Cleanup: Remove the use of lp rather than lpr; all supported systems
can or even should be using CUPS rather than legacy lp.

Cleanup: Remove /usr/bin/sh override in PrintServiceLookupProvider.java.

Cleanup: nullptr in solaris_x86.

Cleanup: remove unused first argument to mpss_sanity_check().

Cleanup: remove unused large_page_range.

Cleanup: remove cond_init and friends. They were defined as the
pthread equivalents but aren't used anywhere any more.

25+17

Minor patch noise.

Boot jdk is now jdk24.

Cleanup: Define -D_REENTRANT for non-gcc (ie clang) builds

Cleanup: Replacing usage of NULL with nullptr.

25+16

Minor patch noise.

25+15

More mucking about with Makefiles

Removed AttachOperationFunctionInfo and enable_dprobes from
attachListener, failed to compile.

25+14

The Makefiles around threading libraries were reworked. While tidying
that up, as all current versions of Solaris and illumos don't need any
explicit threading libraries at all, it's all in libc, remove use of
-lthread.

25+13

Trivial patch noise.

Removal of c1 and c2 in src/hotspot/os/solaris/vmStructs_solaris.hpp.

25+12

Trivial patch noise.

Cleanup: remove unused register stack functions. See the bug
8253457: Remove unimplemented register stack functions
The change for that not only removed the itanium only register
stack functions, but also the base_of_stack_pointer routines
which I keep for now as they were implemented and used on sparc.

Cleanup: closer alignment of formatting in os and os_cpu with the
corresponding linux files, to make it easier to identify genuine
differences between the port.

Cleanup: Remove unused global UseOSErrorReporting.

Cleanup: Remove the mapfile fragments in make/hotspots/symbols;
they're in the wrong place and no longer used as of 23+12.

25+11

Minor patch noise.

Needed to fix pipewire, add an extra hunk to illumos-port-27.patch

25+10

Much patch noise, it appears there's an attempt to guard Makefiles
against multiple inclusion.

Cleanup: Remove long unused sysThreadAvailableStackWithSlack()

Cleanup: Remove Execution protection violation code, which was only
for 32-bit, guarded on other platforms, and disabled by default.

Cleanup: configure by forcing LOCALE to /bin/true, rather than setting
SORT. This falls back to the C locale (the configure emits a warning
to say so), which works on both illumos and Solaris 11, unlike the
SORT fix which only works on illumos.

Cleanup: Remove 32-bit x86 paths.

25+9

Trivial patch noise.

Fix: align default_stack_size() with other platforms

Cleanup: remove Solaris 2.6 libthread check

Cleanup: remove print_libversion_info(), it's really a no-op as
everything now uses the "new" libthread

Cleanup: drop 2 unnecessary patches
patch-src_hotspot_share_gc_g1_g1Analytics.cpp
patch-make_autoconf_jdk-options.m4

25+8

Trivial patch noise.

Cleanup: fix an assert in fastdebug builds

25+7

Quite a lot of simple patch noise, often a 1 line offset due to
precompiled.hpp no longer being included. Remove the include from our
code too.

More format changes SIZE_FORMAT->%zu

25+6

Quite a lot of rework to fix patch noise.

In ProcessHandleImpl, the old unix_getchildren has been moved to a
local implementation os_getchildren in the os-specific file. And also
getParentPidAndTimings() and getCmdlineAndUserInfo().

String format changes UINTX_FORMAT->%zu INTX_FORMAT->%zd

The deprecation message in libjsig wants a new array
deprecated_usage[] which needs handling like sact; I punted and used
_SIGRTMAX rather than SIGRTMAX, but left sact dynamic.

25+4, 25+5

Trivial patch noise.

25+3

Modest patch noise.

25+2

ReservedSpace::page_align_size_down() replaced by os::align_down_vm_page_size()

25+0, 25+1

Start with no changes from 24+27.
