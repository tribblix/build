# Note: to build this on current systems requires a couple of changes
# so you can either go downrev, or apply fixes/workarounds
# 1. It isn't compatible with gmake 4.3, using 4.2.1 is fine if you can
# or look at the bug https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8237879 and apply
# https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk/jdk/rev/0743e1d49930. This is now fixed with
# jdk12-make.patch
# 2. It isn't compatible by default with gcc10, gcc7 is fine but with gcc10
# you'll need to add -fcommon (the problem is that -fno-common is the default)
#
# You first need to download the tarballs
#
# now a single tarball, 80M
#
# initial 12 release:
# wget http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk12/archive/jdk-12+33.tar.bz2
#
# first update
# wget http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk-updates/jdk12u/archive/jdk-12.0.1+12.tar.bz2

# looks like dtrace is busted, I suspect illumos and Solaris have diverged
# enough to trip it up, so --enable-dtrace=no

#
# We need a copy of libsoftcrypto.h
# this was formerly shipped with the source, but got removed as the
# build host is supposed to provide it (either as part of the OS
# or via devkit)
#
# removed in
# http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/rev/9db62c197dcd
# so pull the version from the parent of that commit
