# jdk10 needs objcopy, which is in /usr/gnu/bin
# but the objcopy stuff doesn't actually work
#

#
# jdk10 wants Studio 5.13 == Studio 12.4
#

#
# I have no idea what the version string should look like
#

#
# Note for Solaris 10
# first error is that it wants gmake
# next it wants at least java 8 as the boot jdk
# wants solaris as, so need /usr/ccs/bin in the path
# wants objcopy, at least v21.1 (shipped 2.15 won't work)
# patch 149064-01 or your own copy needed
# needs cups, just copy /usr/include/cups from a system that has it
# gobjcopy stuff doesn't actually work anyway, so try with -k
# get a build error
# "/home/ptribble/ud/openjdk9/hotspot/src/os/solaris/vm/perfMemory_solaris.cpp", line 339: Error: d_fd is not a member of DIR.
# [that's just posix - needs __XOPEN_OR_POSIX defined, or use dd_fd]

# ./bin/java -version
# openjdk version "10.0.2-internal" 2018-07-17

#
# there's a new wrinkle in jdk10. If you put it in /usr/version it fails
#  java.lang.NullPointerException: native ops missing
#     at java.desktop/sun.java2d.xr.XRSurfaceData.freeXSDOPicture(Native Method)
#
# this appears to be an issue wherever it goes if it's that many levels
# deep in the hierarchy, so need to move it up or down a level
#
# until resolved, put it directly in /usr
