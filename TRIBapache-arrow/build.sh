# building with -DARROW_PARQUET=ON fails, see
# https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41338
# the fix is to force int8_t to be explicitly 'signed char'
# rather than 'char' (see /usr/include/sys/int_types.h)
# as in https://www.illumos.org/issues/16523
#
# as the SONAME gets bumped, consumers (ie pyarrow) will need to
# be update and rebuilt at the same time as this package
