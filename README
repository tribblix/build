This is the framework used to build SVR4 packages for Tribblix.

The primary script is dobuild, which unpacks a tarball, runs configure
and make. There are variants mesonbuild (for meson projects), cmbuild
(for cmake projects), and imakebuild (for legacy projects using Imake).

Then genpkg will create a package.

dobuild xrestop-0.4
genpkg TRIBxrestop xrestop-0.4

There are also canned variants (pkg_setup_py, pkg_pep518, pkg_wheel)
for the various styles of python projects. Along with pkg_gem for ruby
gems, and pkg_tarball for simple tarballs.

You need to create a directory for each package. Minimally, this must
contain a pkginfo fragment. There is optionally a depend file with
package dependencies (the autodepend script can help generate that
list). If any SMF services should be restarted on package
install/removal, list them in a restart_fmri_list file. And if you want
to modify the proto area, add a fixit script.

To apply patches, put the patches you need into the patches directory,
and create a pls file named after the (versioned) tarball you're unpacking.
Along with the pls file, you can create preconf and postconf scripts
that run before before and after the configuration respectively.
