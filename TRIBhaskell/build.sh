# note that you need at least 8G free memory as haddock gets that big
# and lots of space in /tmp:
#  the bootstrap kit is 600M
#  the install is 1.8G
#  the package build area is 1.8G
#  the datastream package is 1.8G
#  the final zap package is 300M
#

#
# this is the first bootstrap build
#
# the last version we can use make with is 9.4, but we have to get there
# before we can migrate to hadrian
#
# for 9.4, a 9.2 bootstrap is too new (?!), so use a 9.0 bootstrap from
# https://us-central.manta.mnx.io/pkgsrc/public/pkg-bootstraps/index.html

#
# first we need a copy that works. The binary build for Solaris
# isn't good enough to ship, but it's good enough to bootstrap
# the build. We unpack it and install it into /tmp/local
#

cd ghc-9.0.1-boot

ln -s /usr/gnu/lib/amd64/libncurses.so.6 .
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` ./configure --prefix=/tmp/local
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` gmake install

#
# subsequent builds will hopefully not need the bootstrap build installing
#

#
# then we use that to do the build

# code changes:
# libraries/terminfo/System/Console/Terminfo/Base.hs
#  - simply remove term.h
# libraries/process/cbits/posix/fork_exec.c
#  - defined  _POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS for getpwuid_r (before common.h)
#
# and it can't get on with dtrace
